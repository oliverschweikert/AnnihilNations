# UI Design + Asset Creation

This area of development was overseen by @AmeilBurke, due to his expertise in this area. Regarding AnnihilNations, his responsibilities were:

- Designing & animating the sprites
- Designing the main, pause & options menu
- Designing the in-game UI

## Tools

In order to acheive a high quality product in all these areas, appropriate tools had to be used. These include:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Wd5L0kYUTJRSKH8ZPH9oBW/Designs?node-id=117%3A100) – UI prototyping
- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) – Sprite drawings & animation
- [Wallpaperbetter](https://www.wallpaperbetter.com/en/search?q=1920x1080) – Background images for main menu

## Sprite creation

Our sprites were custom animated using Piskel (see the tools). It was a learning process for everyone.

> In the beginning I found some sprites online and was going to use them until a double check by Oliver showed that the sprites were made for a 2d side-scroller. After hating life for a couple days after that, I went looking for more sprites but could not find any that fit the theme of the game that were isometric, so I decided to take the 2d one’s I found and re-draw them to be isometric. It was a cunt. After redrawing the hero, I realized I would have to draw idle animations in 8 directions. It was also a cunt. Then after creating the 8 direction characters, I created some simple idle, walking & shooting animations to go along with it. After that was done, I did the same thing for the enemy sprites, minus the shooting animations, choosing instead to make some melee animations.

### Changes – Sprite creation

Originally, there were going to be 3 enemy types with their own look and move sets. This was changed to only 1 enemy type because the time required to create & animate them was too high. There were also going to be multiple guns avaiable to choose from for the player character, but it was decided that was outside the scope of this milestone.

> The enemy going to be used was a red minion with a flail. After realizing I did not have the skill to draw that I changed it to a minion with a spear. There were also going to be multiple weapon types, but after realizing that I created the first gun as part of all the animations, I decided to change it to one instead.

## Menus (Main + Option + Pause)

The design for the main & option menus was based off what literally every menu looks like in a game. This was because it is familiar & really had no reason to be any different. The options menu was made to be as simple to use as possible.

The artwork chosen was to show that the game was in a future sci-fi setting.

### Changes - Menu

Because we used a standard model for the menu design, and already had decent art and colors from the beginning, no changes had to be made to the original design.

## Game UI

The in-game menu was simple to design for the current milestone, all we needed was a wave count and a health bar. After @AmeilBurke created the prototype, it was agreed that it contained all the necessary information.

### Changes – In-game UI

The only change that was made was going from a health bar to a heart system as we agreed that this would be a clearer way to display remaining health.
