# Sound Design + Marketing

This area of development was overseen by Kurtis due to his years of musical experience during primary and high school.

His responsibilities were:

- Sourcing all of the game sounds
- Designing and creating the game trailer

## Tools

In order to achieve these responsibilities with a high level of quality the following tools were used:

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
- [MixKit](https://mixkit.co/)

## Game Music

We would have liked to heavily modify the music or even created the music from scratch with software like [FL Studios](https://www.flstudio.com.au/) but due to its expense and quite frankly how long since Kurtis has used this software it was scrapped for simple sound manipulation with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Due to the limitations mentioned above we decided to source all of our music entirely from [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com). Though most music found on SoundCloud isn't royalty free, we searched extra hard for some that was. This means that we can can use the music even in a release version of our game if we desire. Unfortunately due to this, not all of the music that was found was to our liking so this is where [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) come in, allowing easy modification of the music to better suit our needs.

## Sound Effects

All of the sound effects were sourced from [MixKit](https://mixkit.co/) as the ones we were able to find were 100% royalty free which just as the case with the game music, means that it could even be used in a release version of our game.

Fortuantely the game sounds as well as the UI sounds were all found on MixKit and required minimal modification to suit our needs well.

## Game Trailer

[Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) was chosen for creating our game trailer as its free tier is more than enough to make a simple but effective trailer to get viewers interested in our game.

There were some considerations made whilst making the trailer such as avoiding the use of too many effects on the game-play portions of the trailer. This keeps expectations of the game-play inline with what the audience is seeing.

Other considerations included:

- Game objective
- Difficulty showcase
- Broad story outline
- Font size
- Trailer duration
- Export format

## Future Considerations

For a finally release version of our game we would definitely invest in [FL Studios](https://www.flstudio.com.au/) for completely original sound design (for the music side of things at least), which if done right would set our game even futher apart from the competition.

With the addition of more content such as PVE elements and base building components to our game, extra sounds effects, music and potentially even dialog will be required. To achieve this a more extensive means of acquiring/creating sounds will be needed.
